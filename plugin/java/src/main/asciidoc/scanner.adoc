[[PackageScanner]]
==== Package Scanner
Imports Java packages.

[[:Package]]
===== :Package
A Java package, i.e. a directory containing '.class' files or other directories.

.Properties of :Package
[options="header"]
|====
| Name       | Description
| fqn        | Fully qualified name, e.g. 'java.lang'
| name       | The local name, e.g. 'lang'
|====

.Relations of :Package
[options="header"]
|====
| Name         | Target label(s) | Cardinality | Description
| CONTAINS     | <<:Type>>       | 0..n        | References a type located in the package
| CONTAINS     | <<:Package>>    | 0..n        | References a package located in the package
|====

[[ClassScanner]]
==== Class Scanner
Imports Java classes, i.e. all scanned files having a '.class' suffix. Nodes with following labels will be created:

<<:Type>>
<<:Field>>
<<:Method>>
<<:Parameter>>
<<:Value>>

*NOTE* Some of these labels may be further qualified with other labels, see the description below.

*NOTE* The full set of information is only available for class files which have actually been scanned. Types which are
only referenced (i.e. from external libraries not included in the scan) are represented by ':TYPE' nodes with a
property 'fqn' and 'DECLARES' relations to their members. These are ':FIELD' or ':METHOD' labeled nodes which only 
provide the property 'signature'.

[[:Type]]
===== :Type
A Java type. Can be qualified by either ':Class', ':Interface', ':Enum' or ':Annotation'

.Properties of :Type
[options="header"]
|====
| Name       | Description
| fqn        | Fully qualified name, e.g. 'java.lang.Object'
| name       | The local name, e.g. 'Object'
| visibility | optional, the visibility of the type, can be either 'public', 'protected', 'default' or 'private'
| abstract   | optional, 'true' indicates that the type is abstract, e.g. 'public abstract class ...'
| static     | optional, 'true' indicates that the type has the static modifier, e.g. 'private static class ...'
| final      | optional, 'true' indicates that the type is final, e.g. 'public final class...'
| synthetic  | optional, 'true' indicates that the type is synthetic, i.e. it has been generated
|====

| DECLARES     | <<:Method>>           | 0..n        | Declares a method of the type
| DECLARES     | <<:Field>>            | 0..n        | Declares a field of the type

| ANNOTATED_BY | <<:Value:Annotation>> | 0..n        | References an annotation which is present on the type
| DEPENDS_ON   | <<:Type>>             | 0..n        | References a type which this type depends on (i.e. every reference to another class)
|====

*NOTE* Types which are referenced by scanned classes but have not been scanned themselves will only provide the property "fqn"
and the relation "DECLARES".

*NOTE* Inheritance between interfaces (i.e. "public interface A extends B { ... }") is represented using IMPLEMENTS relations, i.e. queries must
 use (a:Type:Interface)-[:IMPLEMENTS]->(b:Type:Interface) for pattern matching.
