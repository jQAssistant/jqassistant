ifndef::jqa-in-manual[== Version 1.8.0]
ifdef::jqa-in-manual[== Java Plugin 1.8.0]

* Added concept `java:VirtualDependsOn` providing `VIRTUAL_DEPENDS_ON` relations based on `DEPENDS_ON` relations to super classes
* Added concept `java:VirtualInvokes` providing `VIRTUAL_INVOKES` relations representing virtual invocations
* Deprecated concept `java:InvokesOverriddenMethod` as it creates`INVOKES` relations that may be ambiguous (replaced by `VIRTUAL_INVOKES`)
* Type members (i.e. fields and methods) are now reported only using their signature.
Example: `com.acme.Foo#void doSomething()` is now reported as `void doSomething()`
* Migrated the following concepts from the `Java 8` plugin into this plugin:
** `java8:FunctionalInterface` -> `java:FunctionalInterface`
** `java8:DefaultMethod` -> `java:DefaultMethod`
** `java8:LambdaMethod` -> `java:LambdaMethod`
