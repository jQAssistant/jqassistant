Imports file resources from URLs as <<:File>> nodes.

Furthermore, a protocol scheme `jqassistant-plugin` is available which allows scanning file resources which are packaged within jQAssistant plugins, e.g. `jqassistant-plugin:my-resource.xml` for a file which is packaged `/my-resource.xml` within a plugin.
