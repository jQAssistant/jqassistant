ifdef::jqa-in-manual[== Maven 3 Plugin 1.6.0]

* Resolve the dependency tree for the artifacts generated by a Maven project which can be queried by
  ```MATCH (p:Maven:Project)-[:CREATES]->(a:Artifact)-[:DEPENDS_ON*]->(d:Artifact) RETURN *```
* Added to the documentation that the declared dependencies of a Maven plugin
  can be queried by using the outgoing `DECLARES_DEPENDENCY` relation of
  the node for a Maven plugin.
* The information of the SCM (Source Control Management) section of a POM
  is now also part of the graph model. The node for the SCM information
  can be queried with a query like `MATCH (p:Maven:Pom)-[:HAS_SCM]\->(s:Maven:Scm) RETURN s`.
* The URL of the project home is now available as property of the node for the Maven POM
  and can be retrieved via the property `url`. A query to access the project home
  could be written as `MATCH (p:Maven:Pom) RETURN p.url`.
