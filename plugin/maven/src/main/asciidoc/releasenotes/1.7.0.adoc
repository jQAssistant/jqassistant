ifdef::jqa-in-manual[== Maven 3 Plugin 1.7.0]

* Added a label `Effective` for `:Maven:Pom` nodes to represent the effective model of a project or artifact
* Fixed a problem where in a multi module Maven project resolved dependencies between artifacts have been created multipe times
* Improved graph model to support for exclusions on declared or managed dependencies:

  (:Pom)-[:DECLARES]->(dependency:Maven:Dependency)-[:TO_ARTIFACT]->(:Maven:Artifact),
  (dependency)-[:EXCLUDES]->(:Maven:Exclusion)

NOTE: The previously used graph model `(:Pom)-[:DECLARES_DEPENDENCY]\->(:Maven:Artifact)` is still supported but deprecated.
 It will be removed in upcoming releases.

* Fixed Maven project scanner to add label `:File` only to `:Maven:Artifact` nodes if the corresponding Maven artifact has been scanned
* Upgraded Maven core and plugin dependencies to Maven 3.5.0
