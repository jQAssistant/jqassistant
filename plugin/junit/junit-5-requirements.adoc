= Requirements for JUnit 5 Support in jQA

- Detect methods annotated with `@Test`, `@ParameterizedTest`, and `@RepeatedTest`
  and label them with the labels `Test` and `junit5`

  Done:
    - Methods annoated with @Test will be processed correctly
    - Methods annotated with @RepeatedTests will be processed correctly
    - Methods annotated with @ParameterizedTest will be processed correctly

- Detect classes (also inner classes, nested classes ) containing tests and label them with the labels
  `junit5` and `Class`.

- Label nested test classes with the label Junit5, TestClass, NestedT

- Detect all test methods and classes with tests and label them with the labels
  `junit5` and `Test`
- Detect all test classes and test methods annoated with `@Disabled` and
  label them with `Junit5`, `Disabled` and `Ignore`.

  Done:
    - Methods are handley correctly
    - disabled classes

  Open:

  To decide:
    - should methods in a class annotated with @Disabled also be labled
      with Disabled?
      - if yes, should we to this also for JUnit 4?

- Detect all JUnit 5 test classes and test methods annotated with `@Ignore` and
  label them with the label `Disabled`

  Open:
    - Check if we lable them also with Ignore

- Detect all methods annotated with `@BeforeEach` and label them with
  `Junit5`, `Before`, `BeforeEach`.

  Done:
    - all

- Detect all methods annotated with `@AfterEach` and label them with
  `Junit5`, `After`, `AfterEach`

  Done:
    - all

- Detect all methods annotated with `@BeforeAll` and label them with `Junit5`, `BeforeClass`
  and `BeforeAll`

- Detect all methods annotated with `@AfterAll` and label them with `Junit5`, `AfterClass`
  and `AfterAll`

== Other issues

- Check if the Surefire reports can be still processed

== Unclear

- @TestFactory
- @TestInstance
- @TestTemplate
- @Nested
- @Tag
- @Displayname
- Meta-Annotations and Composed Annotations
- Constraints to support the transistion from 4 to 5

== Doc updates

- Classes with tests are not longer labled as Test, also for Junit 4 & 3. Ask Dirk about it.!?
