= Requirements for JUnit 5 Support in jQA

- port junit4:AssertMethod
- port junit4:AssertionMustProvideMessage
- port <constraint id="junit4:TestMethodWithoutAssertion">

- Reason why a test has been disabled should be accessibïœ€le.
- support for @Displayname


- Replaced Tag with Tagged

- Ask Dirk about the implication of     <group id="junit4:Default">
                                            <includeConstraint refId="junit4:AssertionMustProvideMessage"/>
                                            <includeConstraint refId="junit4:TestMethodWithoutAssertion"/>
                                            <includeConstraint refId="junit4:IgnoreWithoutMessage"/>
                                        </group>

   moved to junit-common.xml
   Are default groups activated by default?

== Other issues

- Add notes to the documentation that on the special case
  on test reports and repeated and paremterized tests

== Unclear

- @TestFactory   (:Junit5:Testfactory)



== Doc updates


== Done
- port <constraint id="junit4:IgnoreWithoutMessage">
- Also class with @Tag and without tests should be tagged with Tag
- support for Meta-Annotations and Composed Annotations
- Usage of label testcase in the following concepts in junit4.xml
   - junit4:TestCaseDefinedByClass
   - junit4:TestCaseImplementedByMethod

- port junit4:TestCaseImplementedByMethod
- Relation DEFINED_BY and IMPLEMENTED_BY
- Check if the Surefire reports can be still processed

- Compare the lables used by the testNG plugin with the lables
  used by the Junit plugin
- Label nested test classes with the label Junit5, TestClass, NestedT
- @Tag support

- @TestTemplate

- @TestInstance will be not supported with labels and concepts

- Detect all test methods and classes with tests and label them with the labels
  `junit5` and `Test`

  Done:
  - all

- Detect methods annotated with `@Test`, `@ParameterizedTest`, and `@RepeatedTest`
  and label them with the labels `Test` and `junit5`

  Done:
    - Methods annoated with @Test will be processed correctly
    - Methods annotated with @RepeatedTests will be processed correctly
    - Methods annotated with @ParameterizedTest will be processed correctly

- Detect all methods annotated with `@BeforeEach` and label them with
  `Junit5`, `Before`, `BeforeEach`.

  Done:
    - all

- Detect all methods annotated with `@BeforeAll` and label them with `Junit5`, `BeforeClass`.

- Detect all methods annotated with `@AfterAll` and label them with `Junit5`, `AfterClass`.

- Detect all JUnit 5 test classes and test methods annotated with `@Ignore` and
  label them with the label `Disabled`

- Detect all methods annotated with `@AfterEach` and label them with
  `Junit5`, `After`, `AfterEach`

  Done:
    - Methods are handley correctly
    - disabled classes

- Detect all test classes and test methods annoated with `@Disabled` and
  label them with `Junit5` and `Ignore`.
