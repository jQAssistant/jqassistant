<<YAMLFileScanner>>
[[YAMLFileScanner]]
== Generic scanner for YAML files

Imports http://yaml.org/spec/1.1/[YAML 1.1] files in a generic representation
for jQAssistant.

Seen from a more formal perspective a YAML document is build by a tree of nodes.
Each node can have one of the following values as content: scalar value, sequence
or mapping. This plugin imports a YAML file in a simplified manner as simply
model of keys and values. See section <<yaml-examples>> for examples.

IMPORTANT: This YAML scanner supports not the full YAML 1.1 specification as is
is intended to help to scan and validate YAML configuration files with the
help of a simple graph model. If you need an better support for YAML files,
please report a feature request.
