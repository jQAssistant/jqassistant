ifdef::jqa-in-manual[== Commandline Tool 1.3.0]

- Maven coordinates changed from `com.buschmais.jqassistant:commandline`
  to `com.buschmais.jqassistant:jqassistant-commandline`. Therefore the name of the
  commandline distribution changed from `commandline-1.3.0.zip` to
  `jqassistant-commandline-1.3.0.zip`.
- Renamed command line option `severity` to `violationSeverity`, i.e. the threshold for exiting with an error code
  after at lease one rule has failed
- Added command line option `warnSeverity` to set the threshold for logging warnings about failed rules to the console
- Added command line options `defaultConceptSeverity`, `defaultConstraintSeverity` and `defaultGroupSeverity`
- Added command line options `storeUri`, `storeUsername` and `storePassword` for initial support of remote Neo4j 3.x databases
