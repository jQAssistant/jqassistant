ifdef::jqa-in-manual[== Core Framework 1.8.0]

* Fixed a StackOverflowError if a concepts requires itself, e.g. by using wildcards (see https://github.com/jQAssistant/jqa-core-framework/issues/29[issue])
* Changes for plugin developers:
** Moved package `com.buschmais.jqassistant.core.analysis.api.rule` to `com.buschmais.jqassistant.rule.api.model`
** Moved package `com.buschmais.jqassistant.core.analysis.api.report` to `com.buschmais.jqassistant.report.api.model`
** Plugins using classes from these packages need to adopt their imports, no other changes have been applied
* Upgraded to XO 1.0.0
** The release comes with a https://github.com/buschmais/extended-objects/issues/173[change] that possibly breaks existing plugin implementations: property related annotations (e.g. `@Property`, `@Relationship`) must be placed on Getters, an error will be reported at startup if such annotation is found on a Setter.
* Removed APOC and Graph Algorithms libraries
