=== Concepts and Constraints

Concepts and contraints are used differently by jQAssistant, but they
share the same structure. Therefore contraints and concepts are document
together. Due to the different usage of concepts and contraints, different
default values are used for some of the available options.
Since concepts and constraints are both rules, the term rule is
used for both in this chapter.

A rule in a YAML rule document is represented as a map of keys. The keynames
are the same or very similar to the element and attribute names used in
jQAssistants's XML Schema.

.Keys of a map to specify a rule in a YAML rule document
[cols="2,1,5",options="header"]
|===

| Key
| Cardinality
| Description

| `id`
| 1
| Unique id of the rule.

| `deprecated`
| 0..1
| Marks a rule as deprecated. A given text should be used to inform the
  user of the deprecation and the consequences of the deprecation.

| `description`
| 0..1
| Description of the rule.  Intended to be shown to the user in case
  the verification of the rule failed and to document the rule itself.

| `language`
| 0..1
| Specifies the language the actual rule is written in.

  If not specified it is assumed that the actual rule is written
  in Cypher.

// todo Link to new user guide and to the section about writing rules in other languages than Cypher

| `report`
| 0..1
| Specifies a report which should be generated based on the
  result of the of rule.
  See xref:yaml-report-specification[] for details.

| `requiresConcepts`
| 0..1
| Sequence of rule references to concepts required by the rule.
  Required conceptswill be executed before the rule itself will be executed.
  See xref:yaml-keys-required-concepts[] for details.

| `requiresParameters`
| 0..1
| Sequence of required parameters of the rule.
  See xref:yaml-keys-required-parameters[] for details.

| `severity`
| 0..1
| The serverity of the rule. Must be one of `blocker`, `critical`,
  `major`, `minor`, or `info`.

  If not specified, the default severity
  for a concept is `minor`, for constraint it is `major`.

// todo Link to the section on our severities in the user manual


| `verify`
| 0..1
| The verification method of the rule.
  See xref:yaml-keys-verification-method[] for details.

| `source`
| 1
| The statement representing the rule.

[[yaml-keys-required-concepts]]
.Keys of a map to specify the required concepts
[cols="2,1,5",options="header"]
|===

| Key
| Cardinality
| Description

| `refId`
| 1
| The id of a concept which must be executed before this rule.
  jQAssistant will ensure the required execution order of all concepts.

| `severity`
| 0..1
| The severity to be applied to the referenced rule, overwriting
  the actual specified severity.

| `optional`
| 0..1
| Specifies if a rule is optional or not. Possible values are `true`
  and `false`. The default value is `false`.

// todo Where did we document what optional means?

|===

//------------------------------------------------------------------------

[[yaml-keys-required-parameters]]
.Keys of a map to specify the required parameters
[cols="2,1,5",options="header"]
|===

| Key
| Cardinality
| Description

| `name`
| 1
| The name of the required parameter.

| `type`
| 1
| The data type of the parameter. Must be one of: `boolean`, `byte`,
  `char`, `double`, `float`, `int`, `long`, `short`, `String`

| `defaultValue`
| 0..1
| The default value for the parameter if not specified.

[[yaml-keys-verification-method]]
.Keys of a map to specify the verification method
[cols="2,1,5",options="header"]
|===

| Key
| Cardinality
| Description

| `aggregation`
| 0..1
| Verification should be performed by aggregating the value of a
  specific column. See
  xref:yaml-aggregation-options[] for details.

| `rowCount`
| 0..1
| Verification should be performed by counting the results rows.
  See xref:yaml-rowcount-options[] for details.

|===

If no verification method has been specified, the default
result verification will be performed via rowcounting.

// todo Link to the section on verification in the new user guide


//------------------------------------------------------------------------

[[yaml-aggregation-options]]
.Keys of a map to specify a result verification via aggregation
[cols="2,1,5",options="header"]
|===

| Key
| Cardinality
| Description

| `column`
| 0..1
| The column those value will be used to perform the verification.
  If omitted the first column of the result set will be used for the
  verification.

| `max`
| 0..1
| The allowed inclusive maximal value for the verification used column.

| `min`
| 0..1
| The allowed inclusive minimal value for the verification used column.

|===

// todo document the default values for concepts and the default values for constraints
// todo Document how the verification is done if none of these values are given

//------------------------------------------------------------------------

[[yaml-rowcount-options]]

.Keys of a map to specify a result verification via row counting
[cols="2,1,5",options="header"]
|===

| Key
| Cardinality
| Description

| `max`
| 0..1
| Allowed maximal inclusive number of rows in the result set of a rule.

 For a constraint, the default value is 0, since a constraint may not
 have any results. For a concept, `max` has no default value, that
 means that there is no upper limit for the size of the result set.

| `min`
| 0..1
| Required minimal inclusive number of rows in the result set of a rule.

 For a constraint, the default value is 0, since a constraint may not
 have any results. For a concept, `min` has a default value of 1, as
 a concept must have at least one match to be concidered as successful.

[[yaml-report-specification]]
.Keys of a map to specify a report
[cols="2,1,5",options="header"]
|===
| Key
| Cardinality
| Description

| `primaryColumn`
| 1
| Specifies the column of the result set, which will be overhanded as
  primary column to the plugin generating the report.

  If not specified the first column of the result set will be
  taken als primary column.

| `properties`
| 0..1
| Map with properties, which will be overhanded to the
  plugin generating the report.

| `type`
| 1
| Specifies the report to be generated. Which reports are available
  depends on the used report plugins.
