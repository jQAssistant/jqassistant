* Removed configuration options for APOC and Graph Algorithms.
These will be available as separate plugins, see https://github.com/jqassistant-contrib/jqassistant-apoc-plugin[APOC plugin] and https://github.com/jqassistant-contrib/jqassistant-graph-algorithms-plugin[Graph Algorithms plugin].
* Removed deprecated options `jqassistant.severity`, `jqassistant.failOnViolations`, `jqassistant.server.address` and `jqassistant.server.port`

== 1.7.0

* Added configuration `graphAlgorithmsEnabled` for embedded server and system property `jqassistant.embedded.graphAlgorithmsEnabled`

== 1.6.0

* Removed deprecated system property `jqassistant.server.address` and replaced it by `jqassistant.embedded.listen_address`
* Removed deprecated system property `jqassistant.server.port` and replaced it by `jqassistant.embedded.httpPort`

== 1.5.0

* Added a section `embedded` to the `store` configuration section allowing to configure the embedded Neo4j server (listen address, ports and APOC registration)
* Deprecated system property `jqassistant.server.address` and replaced it by `jqassistant.embedded.listen_address`
* Deprecated system property `jqassistant.server.port` and replaced it by `jqassistant.embedded.httpPort`
* Added system properties `jqassistant.embedded.boltPort` and `jqassistant.embedded.apocEnabled`
* Fixed a problem that parallel builds could not be executed for scan/analyze goals (due to conflicting use of BOLT port)
* Fixed a problem of skipped analysis due to wrong detection of last module in a reactor

== 1.4.0

* Maven plugin automatically selects Neo4j v2 or Neo4j v3 depending on the available Java runtime environment
* Users can now provide the severity for the configuration parameters
  `failOnSeverity`, `warnOnSeverity`, and `storeLifecycle`
  also in lower case letters.
* Users can now provide the severity for the configuration parameter
  `failOnSeverity` and `warnOnSeverity` also in lower case.
* The plugin for Maven now logs the severity of constraint violations
  which will cause the build to fail before the analysis will start.
  It also logs the severity of constraint violations which will
  cause warnings but without failing the build.
* Fixed a bug regarding wrong default values for `warnOnSeverity` and `failOnSeverity`

== 1.3.0

* Added initial support for remote Neo4j 3.x databases (embedded or using bolt protocol)
* Allow switching to Neo4j 3 using property `-Djqassistant.neo4jVersion=3` (experimental)
* Added 'store' configuration section providing configuration options for remote database instances
* Added 'rule' configuration section providing default severities for groups, concepts and constraints
* Deprecated configuration attributes `severity` and `failOnViolations` and replaced them with `warnOnSeverity` and `failOnSeverity`
* Fixed a problem where dependencies between types in different Maven modules have not been resolved

== 1.2.0

* Maven coordinates changed from `com.buschmais.jqassistant.scm:jqassistant-maven-plugin`
  to `com.buschmais.jqassistant:jqassistant-maven-plugin`.
