* Deprecated system property `jqassistant.server.address` and replaced it by `jqassistant.embedded.listen_address`
* Deprecated system property `jqassistant.server.port` and replaced it by `jqassistant.embedded.httpPort`
* Added system properties `jqassistant.embedded.boltPort` and `jqassistant.embedded.apocEnabled`
