ifdef::jqa-in-manual[== Plugin for Maven 1.4.0]

* Users can now provide the severty for the configuration parameters
  `failOnSeverity` and `warnOnSeverity` also in lower case.
* The plugin for Maven now logs the severity of constraint violations
  which will cause the build to fail before the analysis will start.
  It also logs the severity of constraint violations which will
  cause warnings but without failing the build.
