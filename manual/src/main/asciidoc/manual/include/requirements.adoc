== Requirements

- Java Runtime Environment 8 (64 bit recommended) or later (it is still possible to scan & analyze applications which have been compiled with older Java versions)
- at least 1GB of RAM

NOTE: Adjusting memory settings can be achieved by setting the environment variables JQASSISTANT_OPTS (command line) or MAVEN_OPTS (Maven), e.g.

.Windows
----
set JQASSISTANT_OPTS=-Xmx1024M
set MAVEN_OPTS=-Xmx1024M
----

.Linux
----
export JQASSISTANT_OPTS=-Xmx1024M
export MAVEN_OPTS=-Xmx1024M
----
