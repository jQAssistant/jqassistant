== Overview

jQAssistant is a QA tool which allows the definition and validation of project specific rules on a structural level. It is built upon the
graph database http://neo4j.org[Neo4j] and can easily be plugged into the build process to automate detection of constraint violations
and generate reports about user defined concepts and metrics.

Example use cases:

- Enforce naming conventions, e.g. EJBs, JPA entities, test classes, packages, maven modules etc.
- Validate dependencies between modules of your project
- Separate API and implementation packages
- Detect common problems like cyclic dependencies or tests without assertions

The rules are expressed in Cypher - the easy-to-learn query language of Neo4j:

MATCH
  (t:Test:Method)
WHERE NOT
  (t)-[:INVOKES]->(:Assert:Method)
RETURN
  t AS TestWithoutAssertion
