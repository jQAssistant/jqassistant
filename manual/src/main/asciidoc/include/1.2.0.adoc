== 1.2.0

- Improved the layout of the wording and the structure of the
  user manual of jQAssistant.

=== Plugins

==== All

- removed the Maven POM `jqassistant.plugin:jqassistant.plugin.all` from
  jQAssistant

==== Common
- Added a plugin for scanning .tar archives
- jQAssistants logs now debug information on which plugin accepted a resource or not. This
  is helpfull if the result of the scan differs from your exceptation.

==== Maven
- added a relation `HAS_EFFECTIVE_MODEL` from `:Maven:Project` to
  `:Maven:Pom` nodes representing the effective (i.e. interpolated)
  model of a Maven project containing all resolved dependencies, plugins, etc.
