== Requirements

- Java Runtime Environment 7 or later (it is still possible to analyze applications which have been compiled with older Java versions)
- at least 1GB of RAM

NOTE: If Java 7 is used to execute jQAssistant the PermGen size of the JVM must be set to 512MB (-XX:MaxPermSize=512M).
This can be achieved by setting the environment variables JQASSISTANT_OPTS (command line) or MAVEN_OPTS (Maven).
